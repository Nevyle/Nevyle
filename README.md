#### I will soon record videos explaining how to create a bot in discord in a simple way, but you will have to study the discord API yourself, what I will explain is how to start this beautiful journey in the right way!

##### Learning to program takes time but it's worth it, you can be sure 'Copy and Paste' won't always work!
